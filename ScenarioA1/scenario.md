You have started work in charge of UX at dairy plant aiming to restore people's faith in local dairy. It's Tuesday, and the CEO has unveiled two new features to their bottles that will hopefully get them a bigger space on store shelves.

"First," he says, "we shouldn't make our customers follow the herd-no pun intended. If they don't want to twist off a cap, why should we make them? We've designed these so you can squeeze the milk straight through the cap!" He then proceeds to upturn the bottle, and squeeze the milk through the top of the bottle. After a few attempts, he's finally able to get some milk out into the coffee, and everywhere else. 

After a quick cleanup, he continues "Second, if we are to hold ourselves to a different authority, we should make our own standard!" The curtain pulls back to reveal 3 vaguely unfamiliar bottle tops-black, white-and grey. "Black is full, white is skimmed, grey is in the middle. What could be easier!" The board rises to their feet and applauds. "We start production at the end of the month!"

He hops off the platform and approaches you. "So, what do you think? Honestly?"


1. Which, if any, Nielsen Heuristics would help address the CEO's concerns?

2. Outline 2 scenarios that would help you confirm/deny any of the heuristics found in question (1)

3. In your usability scoring, you found that over 50% of subjects would buy the milk with the white lid as they believed it was lactose free. How would you describe this in your report?
